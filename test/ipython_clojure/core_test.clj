;; we need to create sockets for each port and bind them
;; look up how to bind sockets in java
;; those sockets will get messages that we have to respond to
;; all sockets except the heartbeat get messages like this

(def example-message ["u-u-i-d", "<IDS|MSG>", "baddad42","{header}",
                      "{parent_header}", "{metadata}", "{content}","blob"])

;; dictionaries are serialized json

;; two messages to respond to
;; "kernel_info_request" a "kernel_info_reply" should be sent back
;; has information about these
;; http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#kernel-info

;; "execute_request" must eventually send an "execute_reply" request
;; as "ok", "error" or "abort"

;; on the hb_port we just need to echo anything that comes to it
;; set that up first

;; find a clojure zeromq library and use that to bind to the ports
;; at least get something functional that responds
;; set up with channels, something like that for clojure, core.async
;; might be the solution for what we want to do
