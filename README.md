3. add these lines to your ipython_config.py located in .ipython/profile_clojure/ipython_config.py

```
# Set the kernel command.
c = get_config()
c.KernelManager.kernel_cmd = ["/Users/rory/cache/ipython-clojure/bin/ipython-clojure",
                              "{connection_file}"]

# Disable authentication.
c.Session.key = b''
c.Session.keyfile = b''
```

4. run the repl with `ipython console --profile clojure`
